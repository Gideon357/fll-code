## Meeting Goals

* Time trials
  * ev3dev2 against lego python
  * lengthier, more involved program similar to real mission
  * object oriented "clean code" program vs. procedural
* Plans to mitigate slow run/slow brick reboot
  * What do we do when the inevitable happens?
* Pick milestone tracking system and human overseer
* Plan overall code layout
